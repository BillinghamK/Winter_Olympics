# Winter_Olympics
Exploratory analysis is performed on a dataset populated with Winter Olympic medal records. 

It is found that the Games have been expanding despite political problems. The event is now at its largest with 500+ athletes competing in 2014. Gender representation of NOC’s is equaling and there is no evidence for gold medal bias for gender. 

Global population is growing linearly but not equally among countries. 

Global GDP is also growing, but individual GDP for nations is very broad. ‘Wealthy’ countries increasing the mean GDP so that most of the world sits below it. 

An increase in GDP and population has a negative effect on a NOC’s likelihood of an Olympic win.
